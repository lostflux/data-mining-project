\section{Data Collection}~\label{sec:data-collection}
As mentioned in the \hyperref[sec:introduction]{introduction},
we sought to collect data from tech articles and blogs for our study, particularly
centered around topics that are relevant to \emph{machine learning} and \emph{artificial intelligence}.
To do this, we built a web scraper~\footcite[The source-code is available on GitHub; see ][]{functional-scraper}
that would perform a breadth-first crawl of the internet from
a set of given seed URLs,collecting all the text frompages that contained
a substantial count of the keywords we were interested in.
We then compiled the collected data into a dataset of
$17092$ articles, with a total of $28$ million
words~\footcite[The dataset is now open-sorce and available on Huggingface; see ][]{ai_dataset_2023}

In earlier versions of the dataset, we realized that a substantial number of data collected
was, in fact, blurbs for research articles. This was understandable, since we had not
restricted our scraper to only look at web domains that are news outlets,
and many news outlets will link to citation blurbs for relevant research articles.
To mitigate this issue, we decided to explicitly limit our scraper to web domains
that are news outlets, such as
\href{https://www.wired.com}{Wired},
\href{https://www.theverge.com}{The Verge}, and
\href{https://www.technologyreview.com}{MIT Technology Review}.
We only included a few domains for research companies that are prominent drivers
of the conversatiosn around AI, such as
\href{https://deepmind.google}{Google DeepMind},
\href{https://openai.com}{OpenAI},
and \href{https://txt.cohere.com}{Cohere}.
